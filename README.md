# RetinoAI: Advanced Diabetic Retinopathy Staging - A Deep Learning Method for Classifying Diabetic Retinopathy Stages

## Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy, a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if untreated, affects the retina's blood vessels and may have no early symptoms. Regular comprehensive dilated eye exams are crucial for early detection and treatment. However, accurate stage identification often requires expert analysis of fundus images, which is challenging and costly. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic diabetic retinopathy stage detection from single fundus photographs. Our approach also incorporates a multistage transfer learning technique to leverage similar datasets with varied labeling, offering a cost-effective screening solution for early detection.
