# RetinoAI: Advanced Diabetic Retinopathy Staging - A Deep Learning Method for Classifying Diabetic Retinopathy Stages

## Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy, a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if untreated, affects the retina's blood vessels and may have no early symptoms. Regular comprehensive dilated eye exams are crucial for early detection and treatment. However, accurate stage identification often requires expert analysis of fundus images, which is challenging and costly. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic diabetic retinopathy stage detection from single fundus photographs. Our approach also incorporates a multistage transfer learning technique to leverage similar datasets with varied labeling, offering a cost-effective screening solution for early detection.



## Understanding Diabetic Retinopathy: A Medical Overview
For a slight introduction to Diabetic Retinopathy, please refer to the document titled **"Diabetic Retinopathy: Medical Overview"**.
Diabetic Retinopathy progresses in 4 stages:
1. Mild non-proliferative retinopathy: the earliest stage, where only microaneurysms 
can occur.
2. Moderate non-proliferative retinopathy: a stage which can be described by losing 
the blood vesselsâ€™ ability of blood transportation due to their distortion and swelling 
with the progress of the Disease.
3. Severe non-proliferative retinopathy: results in deprived blood supply to the retina 
due to the increased blockage of more blood vessels, hence signaling the retina for 
the growing of fresh blood vessels; 
4. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy: It is the advanced stage, where the growth 
features secreted by the retina activate proliferation of the new blood vessels, 
growing along inside covering of retina in some vitreous gel, filling the eye.
